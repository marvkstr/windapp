# windtech

The purpose of our System is to simplify communication and coordination of repairs between wind farm owners and maintenance workers.
If a wind turbine breaks down, our app makes this easy for the owner to recognize in a wind turbine overview. 
In addition, the app allows the owner to easily arrange a technician for his defective wind turbines
